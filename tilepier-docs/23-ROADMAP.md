# 23 · Roadmap — 8 Weeks to v1.0

Solo-dev cadence; each week ends with a working deployable `main`.
Milestone tags `v0.<week>` deployed to production domain from Week 1
(dogfooding in prod is the QA strategy).

## Week 0 (≈4.5 days) — Spikes
S1–S5 per doc 22 + exit review. **Gate:** all spikes green-or-fallbacked.

## Week 1 — Shell
Repo init (license, CI stubs doc 21, branch protection) · scaffold +
tokens + fonts (doc 12) · TpGrid + host + layout persistence/migrations ·
registry + add/remove drawer · settings page + store · Paraglide EN/VI ·
legal gate + static legal pages (draft text) · error pages + ring buffer.
**Milestone M1:** empty deck you can arrange, in both languages, deployed.

## Week 2 — Tier 1, batch 1
clock · timer (+focusSessions) · calc · notes · todo — tiles + details +
states + tests per DoD. **M2:** the deck is already a usable daily tool.

## Week 3 — Tier 1, batch 2 + proxy skeleton
calendar + lunar module port w/ test vectors · toolbox · quote ·
`/api/_lib` pipeline (KV cache, limiter, breaker, envelope) + `/api/weather`
+ `/api/geocode` live. **M3:** first networked data flows end-to-end.

## Week 4 — Weather · Currency
weather widget+detail (ECharts bridge built here, theme-linked) ·
fx endpoint + snapshot mechanism + currency widget/detail (history chart
against accumulating snapshots) · offline/stale polish pass on both.
**M4:** tier-2 pattern (swr + proxy + echarts) proven and documented back.

## Week 5 — Markets
crypto ticker/klines endpoints · stock quote/series/search endpoints
(budget guard + breaker + Stooq fallback) · markets tile + detail
(candles, ranges, watchlist) · degradation ladder verified by fault
injection. **M5:** the hardest widget done; quota telemetry watched for a
full week from here.

## Week 6 — Map · RSS
maplibre integration + geocode UI + saved places · rss endpoint (SSRF
guards + parser fixtures) + reader UI + OPML. **M6:** all networked
widgets complete.

## Week 7 — Music · Media
FSA + fallback ingestion, worker tag parsing, playback + Media Session +
playlists + resume · media player + subtitles + PiP. Visualizer only if
green on schedule (declared cut-line). **M7:** feature-complete.

## Week 8 — Hardening & Release
PWA per S5 outcome · a11y audit (contrast pairs, focus, SR pass) · perf
pass vs budgets · full manual matrix (doc 19 §5) · doc 10 §8 compliance
checklist · security header verification · public `README.md` (features,
screenshots, self-host guide) + CONTRIBUTING + SECURITY.md · CHANGELOG ·
tag `v1.0.0` → release workflow → notify.

## Release checklist (Week 8 gate, condensed)

- [ ] All widget DoDs checked (doc 19 §6) · zero P0/P1 bugs
- [ ] Budgets green in CI · Lighthouse targets met (doc 01)
- [ ] doc 10 §8 attribution/compliance all checked
- [ ] Legal texts final (vi+en) · LEGAL_VERSION=1 · gate verified pre-JS
- [ ] Secrets grep clean (doc 21 §5) · headers verified in prod
- [ ] Backup export/import round-trip on prod build
- [ ] Rollback runbook tested once (deploy previous version)
- [ ] Repo hygiene: topics, description, social preview, issue templates

## Post-1.0 parking lot (v1.x candidates, not commitments)

per-breakpoint saved layouts · music visualizer + Safari FSA-adjacent
improvements · VN equities (behind flag, source TBD) · quote-as-image ·
calendar year view (worker-calc) · widget instances export as shareable
preset · Turnstile if abuse appears · BroadcastChannel tab sync.

## Slip policy

Order of sacrifice if a week overruns: 1) visualizer, 2) media subtitles
(.srt convert), 3) OPML, 4) quote browse-detail (keep tile), 5) push
media widget whole to v1.0.1. The 15-widget count is protected by cutting
depth, not widgets.
